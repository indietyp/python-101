# Program Structure

A Python program is a sequence of statements. A statement is a line of code that performs some action. For example, the
following program prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Programs are executed from top to bottom. The first statement in a program is executed first, followed by the second
statement, and so on. In the above example, the `print` statement is the only statement in the program, so it is
executed first.

Python programs are whitespace sensitive, meaning that the indentation of a line of code is important. The indentation
of a like is the number of spaces at the beginning of the line. The number of spaces used for indentation must be the
same across all lines of code, we choose to use 4 spaces for indentation. This means that if we talk about an
indentation of 2, we mean 8 spaces.

Programs are structured using indentation. Indentation is the number of spaces at the beginning of a line.
Indentation is used during control flow statements, such as `if` statements and `for` loops. We will cover control flow
in a later section.

An example of indentation is shown below:

```python
if True:
    print("Hello, World!")
```
