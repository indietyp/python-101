"""
Write a program that takes a sentence from the user and prints out the frequency of each word in the sentence.

Extra:
    - Ignore punctuation.
    - Ignore case.
    - Sort the words by frequency.
    - Allow the user to specify in which order the words should be sorted.
        - Most frequent first.
        - Least frequent first.
        - Alphabetical.
        - Reverse alphabetical.
        - By length.
        - Reverse length.
        - By number of vowels.
        - Reverse number of vowels.
        - By number of consonants.
        - Reverse number of consonants.
        - By number of letters.
        - Reverse number of letters.
        - By number of digits.
        - Reverse number of digits.
        - By number of special characters.
        - Reverse number of special characters.
    - Allow the user to load a file instead of inputting a sentence.

Example:
    Input: This is a sentence. This is another sentence.
    Output:
        this: 2
        is: 2
        a: 1
        sentence: 2
        another: 1

Example (extra):
    Input: [load file] example.txt
    Output:
        this: 2
        is: 2
        a: 1
        sentence: 2
        another: 1
