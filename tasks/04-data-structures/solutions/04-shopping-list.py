"""
Create an application that will help you with your shopping.

The application should be able to handle the following commands:
- `add` - adds an item to the shopping list
- `remove` - removes an item from the shopping list by its index
- `print` - prints the shopping list
- `clear` - clears the shopping list
- `done` - exits the application

The application should also handle invalid commands by printing out an error message.

Extra:
    - Allow the user to directly add an item via `add <item>`.
    - Allow the user to input multiple items at once, separated by commas.
    - Allow the user to remove an item by its name.
    - Allow the user to remove directly an item via `remove <item>`.
    - Allow the user to remove by index or name with the same command.
    - Allow the user to remove multiple items at once, separated by commas.
    - Allow the user to either input the command in lowercase or uppercase.

Example:
    Input: add
    Item: Milk
    Input: add
    Item: Eggs
    Input: add
    Item: Bread
    Input: print
    Output:
        [0] Milk
        [1] Eggs
        [2] Bread
    Input: remove
    Index: 1
    Input: print
    Output:
        [0] Milk
        [1] Bread
    Input: clear
    Input: print
    Output:
    Input: done
