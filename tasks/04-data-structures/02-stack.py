"""
Implement a stack, where the user can push and pop elements from the stack,
as well as print the stack.
(A stack is a data structure, where the last element that was pushed is the first
one to be popped. It is called LIFO - last in, first out.)

The user should input the commands one by one. To stop inputting commands,
the user should write `done`. The commands are:
- `push` - pushes the value to the stack
- `pop` - pops the value from the stack
- `print` - prints the stack

Extra:
    - Allow for the `push` command to be written as `push <value>`.
    - Allow multiple values to be pushed at once, e.g. `push 1 2 3`.
    - Allow for the `pop` command to be written as `pop <number>`,
        where the number is the number of elements to pop.

Example:
    Input: push
    Value: 1
    Input: push
    Value: 2
    Input: push
    Value: 3
    Input: print
    Output: [1, 2, 3]
    Input: pop
    Input: print
    Output: [1, 2]
