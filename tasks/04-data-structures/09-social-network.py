"""
Create a program that will help you manage your social network. The program should be able
to handle the following commands:

- `create` - create a new user in your social network
- `add` - adds a connection between two users in your social network
- `remove` - remove a connection between two users in your social network
- `print` - prints your social network
- `clear` - clears your social network
- `done` - exits the application

The application should also handle invalid commands by printing out an error message.

Extra:
    - Allow the user to directly add a friend via `add <from> <to>`.
    - Allow the user to remove a friend via `remove <from> <to>`.
    - Allow to add and remove via name or index.
    - If a user does not exist when adding a friend, create the user.
    - Add a command `mutual` that will print out all the mutual friends between two people.
    - Add a command `friends` that will print out all the friends of a person.
    - Add a command `has-connection-between <from> <to>` that will print out whether there
        is a connection between two people. Hint: use DFS, BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm.
    - Allow the user to input multiple friends at once, separated by commas.
