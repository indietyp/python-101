"""
Write a program for a classroom. The program should be able to record the students' names
and their grades. Your program should be able to take the following commands:

* `add <name> <grade>` - add a student to the classroom
* `remove <name>` - remove a student from the classroom
* `print` - print the students and their grades
* `exit` - exit the program

Help: You can use `.split()` to split a string into a list of words.

Extra:
    - Add a command `average` which prints the average grade of the students.
    - Add a command `top` which prints the student with the highest grade.
    - Add a command `top <number>` which prints the top `<number>` students.
    - Add a command `bottom` which prints the student with the lowest grade.
    - Add a command `bottom <number>` which prints the bottom `<number>` students.
    - Add a command `save <filename>` which saves the students and their grades
        in a file.
    - Add a command `load <filename>` which loads the students and their grades
        from a file.

Example:
    Input: add John 5
    Input: add Jane 4
    Input: add Bob 3
    Input: print
    Output: John 5, Jane 4, Bob 3
    Input: remove Jane
    Input: print
    Output: John 5, Bob 3
    Input: exit
