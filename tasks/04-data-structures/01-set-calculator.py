"""
Write a program that reads two sets of numbers and prints the result of the following
operations on them:
* "union" - the union of the two sets
* "intersection" - the intersection of the two sets
* "difference" - the difference of the two sets
* "symmetric difference" - the symmetric difference of the two sets

The numbers should be inputted one by one. To stop inputting numbers, the user should
write `done`.

Extra:
    - Parse the input as a single string, which is comma separated, and then split it.
    - Allow the user to also use
        `|` for union,
        `&` for intersection,
        `-` for difference and
        `^` for symmetric difference.

Example:
    First set: 1
    First set: 2
    First set: 3
    First set: 4
    First set: done
    Second set: 3
    Second set: 4
    Second set: 5
    Second set: 6
    Second set: done
    Operation: union
    Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
