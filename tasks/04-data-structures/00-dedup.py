"""
Create a program that takes a list of numbers from the user and prints
out the list without duplicates. The list **must** preserve the order.

To input a list of numbers, you should ask the user to input a number until the write
`done`.

Extra:
    - Use a set to solve the problem.
    - Parse the input as a single string, which is comma separated, and then split it.

Example:
    Input: 1
    Input: 2
    Input: 3
    Input: 1
    Input: 2
    Input: done

    Output: [1, 2, 3]
