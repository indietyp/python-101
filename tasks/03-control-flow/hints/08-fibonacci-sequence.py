"""
Write a number that takes a number from the user and prints the first n numbers in the
Fibonacci sequence.

First two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the
sum of the previous two.

Hint: You can use `print(a, end=' ')` to print something without a newline.

Example:
    Enter a number: 10
    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
