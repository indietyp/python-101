"""
Take two strings from the user and print the length of the two strings combined together.
The two strings should be combined together with a space in between them.

Hint: You can use the input() function to take input from the user,
        and the len() function to get the length of a string.

Example:
    Enter a string: Hello
    Enter another string: World

    Output: Hello World
    Length: 11
